# youtube-subcount

YouTube subcount is a way for us to create a virtual community for a YouTube channels fanbase. We have created a system where a new particle is spawned for every subscriber a channel has, and it is possible for fans of the community to claim particles as their own. This creates a sense of togetherness for the community as they own a little part of it, and can interact with the other owners.
